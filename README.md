# Overview

For several months now I have felt that my knowlage of databases isnt up to speed with my related skills, especially when it comes to data munging. To teach myself I created some simple software that integrates with Google firebase.

This softwawre is a contact list that is accessed with a simple CRUD menue in the terminal.

# firebase Database

My NoSQL cloud database has only one collection to which the user can add documents. Each document is a contact, who has multiple fields.

# Development Environment

I used the firebase_admin library in python.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

* add some data (like emplyee preformace or somthing) that can be queried and visualized
* Connect to webapp
